# Training
The following document outlines the requirements and design for the bots (PAUL's) training system. 
The training system is responsible for tracking the training points and completion of training for targets.

It is important to understand that these are 2 separate concepts

**1. Training Points** (Trainer)
> The points a user has earned for training others. This is used for example for rewards and commendations.

**2. Trained Completion** (Trainee)
> The completion of training for a user. This is used for example for eligibility for promotions.

# Files
Following is a list of files that are part of the training system. This excludes generic files like `config.py` and `models.py`.

# Abbreviations
The following abbreviations are used in this document:
- USN: United States Navy of SOT
- NRC: New Recruit Command
- NETC: Naval Education and Training Command
- JLA: Junior Leadership Academy
- SNLA: Senior non-commissioned officer
- OCS: Officer Candidate School
- SOCS: Senior Officer Candidate School

# Considerations
There should be someway for a user to check their training points. 
So they know if everything is being added correctly. And they can alert us if something is wrong.

# Adding training points
To add training points to a target, the bot will watch for message in certain channels. When a message is detected, the bot will add training points to the target. 
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Sailor (Target)
    participant L as USN @ training-log
    participant B as Bot
    participant DB as Database
        
    B-->L: listen for message
    S->>L: message
    B->>DB: get_or_create_target
    DB-->>B: target: Training
    B->>DB: increment_nrc_trained_points
    DB-->>B: target: Training

    
    S->>L: remove message
    B->>DB: get_or_create_target
    DB-->>B: target: Training
    B->>DB: decrement_nrc_trained_points
    DB-->>B: target: Training
```

We have 2 type of points to worry about

| NRC  | New Recruit Command (NRC) training points. This is the basic training given for training new recruits.                                                      |
| NETC | Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) training points. This is the advanced training given. This may include several categories of training.          |
